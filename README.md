# Coding Test

This application exposes an API that we use internally for tracking jobs that we post.
We would like to be able to update our postings with the name of the successful candidate
after they accept a position with us, however our current API only allows us to create,
review and delete postings from our job-bank database. Additionally, we would like to
use our **postingId** instead of the id generated by MongoDB for reviewing, updating
and deleting our postings.

Your task is to modify the API to allow us to update, review and delete our postings
using the **postingId**.
